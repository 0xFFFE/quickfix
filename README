This is a fork to meet my requirements. If you have no specific requirements fulfilled by this fork, then it would be better to use the original. It may be of interest when:

1. SSL connections are required.

2. SunOS or AIX are platforms of interest.

3. Order of fields/tags for outgoing messages is important (configurable, not on by default).

4. There is also some EMX platform related functionality which can be enabled through
a compile flag.

5. Arbitrary precision (upto nanoseconds) timestamps need to be handled.
