  QuickFIX will validate and reject any poorly formed messages before they can reach your application.
  QuickFIX can also dynamically load an XML
  definition file for each session which will further validate that each message is a supported type,
  that they don't contain unsupported fields, that no required fields are missing etc.
  </p>
  <p>
  QuickFIX comes with several standard files in the <i>spec</i> directory.
  These can be cloned and modified to fit your messaging requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
  If, for instance, you need to define a FIX spec for a sell side application.  Why not define the
  spec in XML and then just publish the XML file to your clients! Not only is your FIX spec fully documented
  in a machine and human readable format, but you can guarantee that the documentation is 100%
  accurate because it is actually <B>defining</B> not describing your FIX messages.
  </p>
  <p>
  And if XYZ corp needs some special fields added to their session but you don't want to expose
  them to anyone else, fine. Create XYZ.xml, load it up with the session and keep everyone else
  using the normal definintion file. Now XYZ can send their user defined fields but they will be rejected
  for anyone else.
  </p>
  <p>
  The skeleton of a definition file looks like this.

  <p>
  The validator will not reject conditionally required fields because the rules for them are not
  clearly defined and are often debatable. QuickFIX will reject a conditonally required field when
  you try to pull it out in your <B>fromApp</B> function if you try to get a field that is not there.
