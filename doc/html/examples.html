    <p>QuickFIX comes with several example applications. These
    application are in the <b>quickfix/examples</b> directory.
    These applications are not meant to demonstrate good
    application design or meant to be used in a real production
    system. They are merely provided as a tutorial on how to build
    an application with QuickFIX.</p>

    <p>The applications provided are <b>ordermatch</b> which is a
    c++ server that will match and execute limit orders, and
    <b>tradeclient</b> is a little c++ console based trading
    client. <b>Banzai</b> is a Java GUI based trading client.
    Finally there is <b>executor</b>. Executor is a server that
    simply fills every limit order that it receives. Executor has
    been implemented in <i>C++, Python</i> and <i>Ruby</i>. This is
    a great example for demonstrating how to do the same things in
    all of QuickFIX's supported API's.</p>

    <p>Please study these examples to see a complete although
    minimal implementation of a FIX application.</p>
